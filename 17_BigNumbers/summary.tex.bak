Imagine you are given pen with enough ink to write 20 centimeters and you are to write the biggest number you can think of. You can start by a tower of exponents $10^{10^{\cdots^{10}}}$, but it is not that big. In this chapter we explore the hierarchy from computable functions to TREE(3) â€” a number so immense that even if you built a tower of exponentials starting with a trillion raised to the power of a trillion, and then repeated that construction every attosecond for a trillion years, the result would still be vanishingly small in comparison. Yet even TREE(3) sits as close to infinity as the number 8, placing us in an infitiy zoo where sizes exceed the categories brains evolved to handle.
