  \textbf{Top (Valid TREE(3) Sequence Prefix):}  
  An initial segment of a TREE(3)-avoiding sequence. Each rooted tree is added in such a way that no earlier tree is homeomorphically embeddable into a later one. The sequence starts with simple trees and becomes rapidly more complex. Exponentiating a googolplex by itself a googolplex times is comically dwarfed by TREE(3). \par

  \textbf{Bottom (Largest Number Competition):}  
  Using 20cm of ink, write the largest number possible. Early entries include exponential towers and Knuth up-arrow notation. But one leverages the TREE function hierarchy in $\text{TREE}(\text{TREE}(3))$ â€” a number vastly larger than previous contenders. The final banner is a different type of entry, more reminiscent of Rayo's number. \par
