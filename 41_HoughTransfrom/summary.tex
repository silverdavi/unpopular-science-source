The Hough transform detects geometric shapes in images by converting the problem from image space to parameter space. Images undergo edge detection to identify significant brightness transitions. Each edge pixel then "votes" for all possible geometric structures that could contain it. For line detection, edge point generate constraints in parameter space through the relation $b = y_0 - mx_0$. Points lying on the same line create intersecting lines in parameter space, forming accumulator peaks.
