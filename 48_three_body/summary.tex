Deterministic systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, where minuscule differences in initial conditions lead to drastically different outcomes over time. The double pendulum and the three-body gravitational problem exemplify that this phenomenon can happen despite having few components and simple governing equations. Counterintuitively, billions of times more complex physical systems like falling objects often display predictable behavior. This is because dissipative effects continuously suppress perturbations.
