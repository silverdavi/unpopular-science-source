  \textbf{Sequencing as Text Reconstruction:}  
  The image parallels DNA sequencing to reassembling a book from shredded fragments from hundreds of identical copies. The books are pulverized into overlapping sentence fragments â€” analogous to sequencing short reads from long DNA strands. By aligning overlapping sequences, the original string is reconstructed. As with genome assembly, redundancy, overlaps, and statistical inference allow one to piece together each chromosome from fragmented reads. \par
