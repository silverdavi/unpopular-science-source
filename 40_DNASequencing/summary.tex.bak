DNA sequencing has evolved from Sanger's chain-termination method through the next-generation revolution of 454 pyrosequencing, Ion Torrent, and Illumina platforms to modern nanopore technologies. The computational challenge of genome assembly uses sophisticated algorithms like de Bruijn graphs to reconstruct complete genomes from millions of short fragments, while paired-end chemistry and long-read technologies help resolve repetitive regions that have long frustrated genomic reconstruction efforts.
