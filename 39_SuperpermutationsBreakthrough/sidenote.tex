  \textbf{Superpermutation over Anime Orders:}  
  The sequence 1,2,3,1,2,1,3,2,1 visits all six permutations of $\{1,2,3\}$ as contiguous subsequences: 123, 231, 312, 213, 132, 321. Here, episode "1" is \emph{Dragon Ball Z} (Vegeta), "2" is \emph{One Piece} (Straw Hat Crew), and "3" is \emph{Sailor Moon}. This is a minimal superpermutation for $n=3$: the shortest possible viewing order that guarantees every order of watching (back-to-back) all three shows appears. \par
