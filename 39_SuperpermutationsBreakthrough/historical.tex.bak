\begin{historical}
From the late 19th century, combinatorial mathematics developed tools for enumerating and arranging discrete structures. Permutations — ordered arrangements of elements — became central objects of study, with applications ranging from algebra to scheduling theory. One question was about sequences that embed all permutations of a given set as contiguous substrings. Though such sequences appeared in scattered contexts, the idea of minimizing their length — the superpermutation problem — remained informal and largely unexplored.

By the late 20th century, empirical exploration suggested that for small $n$ the minimal lengths matched the sum-of-factorials pattern, $L(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n k!$. This led to a widely discussed but unproven conjecture that the pattern might hold in general.

The situation changed dramatically in 2011 when an anonymous user on 4chan’s science board posed a variation of the problem in the context of anime episode viewing order. In response, another user posted a rigorous lower bound on superpermutation length, unnoticed by the broader community for years. Independent developments followed: in 2014, a construction of length 872 for $n=6$ appeared, disproving the factorial-sum conjecture. Soon after, mathematicians formalized the 4chan insight, and Greg Egan proposed a new upper bound, narrowing the known range.
