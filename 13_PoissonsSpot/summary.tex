Poisson’s spot, also called the Arago spot, demonstrates wave diffraction through the unexpected appearance of a bright point at the center of a circular object’s shadow. When Augustin-Jean Fresnel proposed light as a wave phenomenon in 1818, Siméon Poisson derived this counterintuitive prediction in an attempt to disprove the theory. The effort backfired when François Arago experimentally confirmed the spot, which corpuscular optics could not explain, providing decisive support for the wave model of light.
