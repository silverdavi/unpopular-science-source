  \textbf{Top (3D Mesh with UV Grid):} A polygonal model is shown with a superimposed UV grid. The grid flattens a surface into 2D coordinates, assigning each vertex a location in texture space. This mapping determines how an image will be wrapped onto the surface. \par
  \textbf{Bottom (Texture Atlas):} A sprite sheet provides the 2D image data: character animations, items, and enemies. Each region of the sheet corresponds to a set of UV coordinates. During rendering, the engine looks up the correct portion of the texture based on UV mapping and projects it onto the surface, aligning 2D artwork with 3D geometry. \par
