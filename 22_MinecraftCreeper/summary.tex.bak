Minecraft’s Creeper began as a mistake. Markus Persson entered the pig’s dimensions backwards, producing a tall, thin figure that looked nothing like an animal. Instead of deleting it, he added a texture, a frown, and an explosive routine borrowed from the game’s block-destruction code. The result was a creature that crept silently, paused, and detonated. A simple modeling error became Minecraft’s most iconic enemy.
