{\Large\textbf{The Epistemic Fragility of Syntax-Only Cognition}}\\[0.3em]

\noindent\textbf{Framing the Dispute}\\[0.5em]
The Chinese Room is not an empirical argument but a methodological critique aimed at conceptual boundaries in cognitive science. Searle's challenge is not about empirical performance but what we are permitted to infer from it. He contends that passing the Turing Test — or any test based solely on linguistic output — cannot entail genuine understanding unless we already have a theory that licenses such an inference. The argument's strength lies in its methodological reversal: where AI seeks to move from behavioral evidence to mental attribution, Searle denies the validity of that inference without a prior grounding in what it means to “understand.”

\noindent\textbf{Understanding Without a Criterion}\\[0.5em]
"Understanding" is not an operationally neutral term. Unlike “predicts weather” or “stores data,” it is irreducibly normative and semantically loaded. To assert that a system understands is to claim it possesses internal relation to meaning — content-bearing capacity that cannot be exhausted by structural descriptions alone. The Chinese Room exposes epistemic laziness: we project understanding onto systems that behave in familiar ways, without specifying what justifies that projection.

Replies to Searle rely on stipulative bridges — identifying understanding with functional role, environmental embedding, or counterfactual dependence. These bridges merely relocate the conceptual burden. What is lacking is a non-circular account of when formal behavior amounts to semantic content. This is not a technical failure but a philosophical silence.

\noindent\textbf{Intentionality and Attribution}\\[0.5em]
Searle's intentionality point is often misconstrued. He is not claiming that syntax cannot, in principle, be paired with semantics. He asserts that such pairing is not guaranteed by formal operations alone. The CRA is not about what symbols do; it is about what they mean. And meaning is not intrinsic to the system unless some internal state stands in a relation of intentional directedness — a relation not captured by computational transitions.

Attempts to circumvent this by pointing to system-wide properties (as in the Systems Reply) or virtual entities (as in the Virtual Mind Reply) fail to address a fundamental asymmetry: intentional states have first-person authority, whereas syntactic states do not. If a system “understands,” then it makes sense to ask what it understands and why. But if that attribution is based only on labeling (e.g., "this system understands Chinese"), we are no longer explaining cognition — merely renaming behavior.

\noindent\textbf{Simulation and Normativity}\\[0.5em]
Searle targets the normative dimension of cognition. Understanding involves norm-sensitive responsiveness to content, not merely causal states. A person can misunderstand, misinterpret, or revise their understanding. These are not errors in computation; they are errors in relation to content. But a syntactic machine cannot err in this sense. It can malfunction, but it cannot misbelieve. Without normativity, there is no epistemic traction, and without that, no understanding.

\noindent\textbf{The Epistemic Cost of Ambiguity}\\[0.5em]
The enduring appeal of the Chinese Room stems from its methodological clarity. It does not claim that AI will never understand. It claims that we lack a criterion by which to know if it does. To assert that future systems might understand language is to talk without terms. Until we have a definition of understanding that does not collapse into performance, or a theory of meaning that does not presume biological embedding, our attributions remain projections — not findings.
