Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment challenges computational theories of mind: someone manipulates Chinese symbols according to rules without understanding the language. They produce appropriate responses, passing a linguistic Turing test, yet possess no comprehension. The argument distinguishes syntax (symbol manipulation) from semantics (understanding), suggesting that computers executing algorithms operate only at the syntactic level. This questions whether systems like large language models truly understand language or merely simulate understanding through statistical pattern recognition.
