In quantum field theory, the vacuum is defined as the field configuration with the lowest possible energy. It is not an absence of matter, but a state of the fields that determine the properties of particles and forces. The Higgs field, which permeates space and gives mass to fundamental particles, has a nonzero value in its vacuum state. This value fixes the parameters of particle physics: the masses of quarks and leptons, the strengths of interactions, and the balance of forces that hold matter together.

A vacuum need not be absolutely stable. The potential energy of a field may contain more than one minimum. A false vacuum is a local minimum that is not the absolute lowest point. It appears stable because fluctuations near the minimum are suppressed, but a still lower minimum exists elsewhere in field space. If the universe is in such a state, it is only metastable: it persists for long times but retains a finite probability of decay.

The mechanism of decay is quantum tunneling. A region of space can fluctuate into the lower-energy configuration, forming a bubble of the true vacuum. Classically, this would be impossible because the field would need to climb an energy barrier to reach the new minimum. Quantum mechanics allows a transition through the barrier. The probability of such a transition is extremely small, but not zero. Once a bubble forms, it expands because the energy density inside is lower than outside. The boundary, or domain wall, accelerates outward until it approaches the speed of light. The expansion cannot be stopped from within the old vacuum.

The consequences are absolute. Inside the bubble, the parameters of physics are altered. Particle masses may take new values, couplings may change, and interactions may follow rules incompatible with the existence of atoms, chemistry, or stable matter. The transition is not a gradual modification but a replacement of the physical framework itself. Everything defined by the old vacuum disappears as the bubble passes.

This possibility has moved from speculation to concrete calculation because of the Higgs boson. Its mass, measured at about 125 GeV, combined with the mass of the top quark, determines the shape of the Higgs potential once quantum corrections are included. Renormalization group analysis shows that the Higgs self-coupling may run negative at very high energy scales. If so, the potential bends downward and develops a new minimum far from the current vacuum. In that case, the present universe is not in the absolute minimum but in a metastable state.

Estimates of the decay rate suggest that the lifetime of such a metastable vacuum is extraordinarily long — far longer than the current age of the universe. This means that the chance of decay within any observable region is negligible on human or even cosmic timescales. Yet the possibility remains that the present configuration of physics is contingent, not permanent. The familiar laws hold only as long as the Higgs field stays in its current minimum.

The geometry of decay has further consequences. Because the bubble wall expands at the speed of light, no observer can see it coming. Signals cannot outrun the front. When the transition arrives, there is no forewarning and no survival. The vacuum does not shift gradually across the universe but transforms locally, bubble by bubble, each expanding at light speed until the entire false vacuum is consumed.

This picture reshapes how permanence is understood in physics. Constants of nature appear fixed, yet they may be fixed only by the persistence of a metastable state. The proton mass, the strength of the weak interaction, the patterns of chemical bonding, and the possibility of stable stars all depend on the Higgs field remaining as it is. If it tunnels away, none of these features are preserved. The universe is revealed not as a final configuration but as a provisional arrangement, resting in a false vacuum that could in principle collapse.

\begin{commentary}[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]
The false vacuum threat exemplifies a recurring pattern in fundamental physics: the most profound threats are the most abstract. Unlike asteroid impacts or supernovae, vacuum decay leaves no debris, no survivors, no record. It represents the ultimate existential risk — not destruction of life or planets, but erasure of the possibility of their existence.

This connects to broader questions about contingency in physics. We typically assume the laws of nature are fixed, that the fine-structure constant and particle masses are eternal features of reality. The false vacuum scenario suggests these may be environmental variables, determined by which minimum the universe happens to occupy. The anthropic principle gains new meaning: we observe these particular constants not because they are necessary, but because other values would not permit observers.

The calculation that places our universe near the stability boundary is particularly unsettling. Had the Higgs been slightly lighter or the top quark heavier, we would inhabit a definitely stable vacuum. Had the parameters been slightly different in the other direction, the vacuum would have decayed long ago. Instead, we find ourselves balanced on the edge — in a metastable state that has persisted for 13.8 billion years but could end tomorrow.

Yet this same calculation offers reassurance. The tunneling probability is so small that the expected lifetime exceeds $10^{100}$ years. No conceivable experiment could trigger decay; the LHC's energies are infinitesimal compared to the instanton scale. Even cosmic ray collisions, which reach far higher energies, have occurred throughout the universe's history without nucleating bubbles. The threat remains theoretical, a reminder that permanence is provisional and existence more fragile than it appears.
