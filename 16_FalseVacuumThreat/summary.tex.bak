Our universe may exist in a false vacuum — a metastable state that could decay through quantum tunneling, producing a bubble of altered physics expanding at light speed. Current Higgs boson measurements suggest that while such decay is improbable for timescales far exceeding the age of the universe, the possibility remains that reality itself could undergo a phase transition that abolishes matter, forces — with the bonus side effect of no more spam.
