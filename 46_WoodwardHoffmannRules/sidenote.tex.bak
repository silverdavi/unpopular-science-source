  \textbf{Top (Thermal Electrocyclic Reaction):}  
  The ring closure proceeds under heat via disrotatory motion. The HOMO is $\psi_3$, antisymmetric, so disrotation preserves bonding overlap. Constructive phase alignment yields product — shown by successful hand-holding of upper dancers. \par

  \textbf{Second (Forbidden Thermal Reaction):}  
  Conrotatory motion under thermal conditions disrupts orbital overlap. Despite symmetrical movement, bonding fails — dancers miss connection. \par

  \textbf{Third (Photochemical Electrocyclic Reaction):}  
  After photoexcitation, the HOMO becomes $\psi_2$, symmetric. Now conrotatory motion preserves phase alignment. The dancers execute a stable hand-linked ring — reaction proceeds. \par

  \textbf{Bottom (Forbidden Photochemical Reaction):}  
  Disrotatory motion with $\psi_2$ breaks symmetry — bonding fails. The dancers’ hands miss again. Only one mode is symmetry-allowed per excitation condition. \par
