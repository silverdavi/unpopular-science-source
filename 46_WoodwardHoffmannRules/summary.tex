The Woodward-Hoffmann rules establish how mathematical symmetry conservation governs chemical reaction pathways at the quantum level. In pericyclic reactions, the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals — represented by wave functions with specific nodal patterns analogous to trigonometric functions — must be conserved throughout the reaction coordinate. This conservation requirement creates selection rules that determine allowed stereochemical outcomes. The symmetry constraints differ fundamentally between thermal and photochemical conditions, as light excitation inverts the orbital symmetry relationships, thereby enabling reaction pathways forbidden under thermal conditions and vice versa.
