\noindent\textbf{Radiative Transfer and Blackbody Radiation}\\[0.2em]
The propagation of specific intensity \( I_\nu \) along a path \( s \) is governed by the equation of radiative transfer:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dI_\nu}{ds} &= j_\nu - \alpha_\nu I_\nu - \sigma_\nu I_\nu \\
&\quad + \iint \sigma_\nu(\Omega', \Omega) I_\nu(\Omega')\, d\Omega'
\end{align*}
where \( j_\nu \) is the emission coefficient, \( \alpha_\nu \) is the absorption coefficient, and \( \sigma_\nu \) is the scattering coefficient. The optical depth is \( d\tau_\nu = (\alpha_\nu + \sigma_\nu)\, ds \). In local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) without scattering, the source function reduces to \( S_\nu = j_\nu/\alpha_\nu \), which approaches the Planck function for thermal emission. With scattering present, the total source function mixes thermal emission and angle-averaged scattered intensity: \( S_\nu = (\alpha_\nu B_\nu + \sigma_\nu J_\nu) / (\alpha_\nu + \sigma_\nu) \), where \( J_\nu \) is the mean intensity.
\[
B_\nu(T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \left[ \exp\left( \frac{h\nu}{kT} \right) - 1 \right]^{-1}
\]
The wavelength of peak emission is given by Wien's law:
\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} T = b \approx 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \cdot \text{K}
\]
and the total emitted flux per unit area follows the Stefan--Boltzmann law:
\[
F = \sigma T^4, \quad \sigma = \frac{2\pi^5 k^4}{15c^2 h^3}
\]
Stellar temperatures can be inferred by fitting observed continua or via color indices (e.g., \( B-V \)), which measure differences in magnitude across filtered bands.

\noindent\textbf{Spectral Lines and Atmospheric Composition}\\[0.2em]
Spectral lines originate from electronic transitions with energy \( \Delta E = h\nu = E_u - E_l \). In LTE, population ratios follow the Boltzmann distribution:
\[
\frac{N_u}{N_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \exp\left( -\frac{E_u - E_l}{kT} \right)
\]
Ionization states are governed by the Saha equation:
\[
\frac{N_{i+1} N_e}{N_i} = \frac{2 g_{i+1}}{g_i} \left( \frac{2\pi m_e kT}{h^2} \right)^{3/2} \exp\left( -\frac{\chi_i}{kT} \right)
\]
where \( \chi_i \) is the ionization energy and \( N_e \) is the electron density. Line shapes are broadened by natural width, thermal Doppler broadening:
\[
\Delta \lambda_D = \lambda_0 \left( \frac{2kT}{mc^2} \right)^{1/2}
\]
and collisional (pressure) broadening, which scales with density. Observed line intensities allow reconstruction of chemical abundances and physical conditions.

\noindent\textbf{Motion, Redshift, and Extinction}\\[0.2em]
The Doppler effect shifts wavelengths by
\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v_r}{c}, \quad (v_r \ll c)
\]
where \( v_r \) is the radial velocity. Redshift (\( \Delta \lambda > 0 \)) indicates recession; blueshift indicates approach. For distant galaxies, the cosmological redshift \( z \) is related to the scale factor \( R(t) \) via $1 + z = R(t_{\text{obs}})/R(t_{\text{emit}})$ and follows Hubble's law for \( z \ll 1 \): \( v = H_0 d \).

Extinction by dust is quantified by
\[
A_\lambda = 1.086\, \tau_\lambda = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( {F_\lambda}/{F_{\lambda,0}} \right)
\]
where \( \tau_\lambda \) is the optical depth. Reddening is the differential extinction between bands:
\[
E(B - V) = A_B - A_V
\]
and the total-to-selective extinction ratio \( R_V = A_V / E(B - V) \) typically has a value near 3.1 for the diffuse interstellar medium. For small particles \( a \ll \lambda \), Rayleigh scattering dominates, with efficiency \( \propto \lambda^{-4} \). For \( a \sim \lambda \), Mie scattering applies, with weaker wavelength dependence.
