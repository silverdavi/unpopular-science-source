The exponential function extends far beyond calculus, appearing across mathematics as a bridge between local and global structure. From power series to Lie theory, from Riemannian geometry to sheaf cohomology, exponential maps carry additive or infinitesimal data into multiplicative, compositional, or curved settings. What began as a trick for quick computation has become a central map linking analysis, geometry, and algebra.
