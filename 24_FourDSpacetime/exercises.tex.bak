    \item \textbf{Scaling Argument}  
    \newline
    A right triangle is uniquely determined by its hypotenuse $c$ and one acute angle $\phi$. The only dimensionally valid expression for its area is
    \[
    \Delta = c^2 f(\phi),
    \]
    where $f(\phi)$ is a dimensionless function.
    \textit{(Why $c$ rather than $a$ or $b$? By similarity, the shape depends on $\phi$ and a squared length. Any side could be used, but expressing the result in terms of $c$ emphasizes the relation to the hypotenuse.)}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
      % Define vertices for a 3-4-5 right triangle with right angle at C:
      \coordinate (B) at (0,0);
      \coordinate (C) at (0,3);
      \coordinate (A) at (4,3);
      
      % Compute foot D of the altitude from C to AB
      \coordinate (D) at (1.44,1.08);
      
      % Draw triangle ABC
      \draw[thick] (A) -- (B) node[midway, below] {$c$};
      \draw[thick] (B) -- (C) node[midway, left] {$a$};
      \draw[thick] (C) -- (A) node[midway, above] {$b$};
      
      % Label vertices
      \node[above right] at (A) {$A$};
      \node[below left] at (B) {$B$};
      \node[above left] at (C) {$C$};
      
      % Altitude from C to AB
      \draw[thick] (C) -- (D) node[midway, left] {$h$};
      \node[below] at (D) {$D$};
      
      % Right angle marker at C
      \draw (C) ++(0.2,0) -- ++(0,-0.2) -- ++(-0.2,0);
      
      % Acute angle at A
      \node at (3.4,2.8) {$\phi$};
      % Angle at C (right angle shown separately)
    
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \item \textbf{Similar Triangles and Decomposition}  
    \newline
    The altitude $CD$ from $C$ to $AB$ divides the original right triangle $\triangle ABC$ into two smaller right triangles, $\triangle CBD$ and $\triangle ACD$. By angle-angle (AA) similarity:
    \[
    \triangle ABC \sim \triangle CBD \sim \triangle ACD.
    \]
    Because area scales as the square of a characteristic length, the sub-areas (corresponding to sides $a$ or $b$) take the form $\Delta_1 = a^2 f(\phi)$ and $\Delta_2 = b^2 f(\phi)$.
    Since the total area is additive,  
    \[
    c^2 f(\phi) = a^2 f(\phi) + b^2 f(\phi).
    \]
    Dividing by $f(\phi)$ (assumed nonzero) gives
    $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.
\end{enumerate}

Dimensional analysis can be rigorously formalized using a graded algebraic structure where physical quantities lie in one-dimensional vector spaces $V^d$ indexed by a group $G$ of exponents (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^n$ for base units). Multiplication corresponds to the tensor product $V^a \otimes V^b \cong V^{a+b}$, and one only adds elements within the same space $V^d$. For example, a quantity in kilograms lies in $V^{(1,0,0,\ldots)}$ and one in meters per second lies in $V^{(0,1,-1,\ldots)}$, reflecting mass and velocity dimensions respectively. Physical laws hold under any consistent rescaling of units, leading to constraints like Buckingham's $\pi$-theorem.
