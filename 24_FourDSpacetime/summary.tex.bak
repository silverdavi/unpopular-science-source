Why does our universe have exactly three spatial dimensions plus time? Multiple independent constraints converge on $D=4$: only in 3D space do inverse-square laws produce stable planetary orbits and bound atoms; only in 4D spacetime are fundamental forces renormalizable in quantum field theory; only in 4D do waves propagate cleanly without trailing echoes (Huygens' principle). The arithmetic fact that $4 = 2+2$ creates unique mathematical properties — from quaternion algebra to self-dual gauge fields — that cascade through physics. Lower dimensions cannot support complex chemistry, while higher dimensions destabilize matter and causality.
