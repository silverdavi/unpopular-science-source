    \textbf{Coulomb Barrier and Characteristic Energies}\\[0.5em]
    In stellar cores, nuclear fusion requires overcoming electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei. The Coulomb potential between two protons is
    \[
    V_\text{C}(r) = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r},
    \]
    where \( Z_1 = Z_2 = 1 \), and \( r \sim 1\,\text{fm} \). Estimating numerically:
    \begin{align*}
    V_\text{C} &\sim \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{C})^2}{4\pi (8.85 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{F/m}) \cdot 1 \times 10^{-15}\,\text{m}}\\
               &\sim 1\,\text{MeV}.
    \end{align*}
    By comparison, the thermal kinetic energy at the Sun’s core temperature \( T \approx 1.5 \times 10^7\,\text{K} \) is:
    \[
    k_B T \approx 1\,\text{keV}.
    \]
    Classically, such energy is insufficient for fusion; quantum tunneling provides a nonzero probability of barrier penetration.

    \textbf{Tunneling Probability and the Gamow Factor}\\[0.5em]
    The tunneling probability is approximated by the Gamow factor:
    \[
    P_\text{tunnel}(E) \sim \exp\left[-2\pi \eta(E)\right],
    \]
    where the Sommerfeld parameter \(\eta(E)\) is defined as
    \begin{align*}
    \eta(E) &= \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{\hbar v}, \\
    v &= \sqrt{2E/\mu},
    \end{align*}
    with \(\mu\) the reduced mass of the two-particle system. Substituting for \(v\), the Sommerfeld parameter becomes
    \[
    \eta(E) = \pi \alpha Z_1 Z_2 \sqrt{\frac{\mu c^2}{2E}},
    \]
    where \(\alpha\) is the fine-structure constant. The exponential suppression governed by \(\eta(E)\) dominates the energy dependence of the fusion rate.
    
    \vspace{0.7em}
    \textbf{Gamow Peak and Effective Fusion Energy}\\[0.5em]
    Fusion occurs predominantly at energies where the product of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and the tunneling probability is maximized. This defines the \emph{Gamow peak}, centered around
    \[
    E_\text{pk} \approx \left( \frac{\pi^2 \mu c^2 \alpha^2 Z_1^2 Z_2^2}{2 k_B T} \right)^{1/3}.
    \]
    The Gamow peak arises from the interplay between thermal distribution (favoring higher energies) and tunneling suppression (favoring lower energies). Although \( E_\text{pk} \ll V_\text{C} \), the overlap is sufficient to permit fusion in a small fraction of collisions.

    \textbf{Thermally Averaged Fusion Rate and the Proton–Proton Chain}\\[0.2em]
    The effective reaction rate is governed by the thermally averaged cross section:
    \[
    \langle \sigma v \rangle = \int_0^\infty \sigma(E)\, v(E)\, f_\text{MB}(E)\, \mathrm{d}E,
    \]
    where \(\sigma(E)\) includes nuclear interaction probabilities and tunneling effects, and \(f_\text{MB}(E)\) is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The dominant fusion pathway in the Sun is the proton–proton chain, initiated by \par
    $p + p \to d + e^+ + \nu_e.$ \par
    Subsequent reactions in the chain yield \( ^4\text{He} \), positrons, neutrinos, and photons. The net energy released per helium nucleus formed is approximately \(26.7\,\text{MeV}\).
