  \textbf{Top (Solar Fusion Process):} This diagram illustrates the \emph{proton-proton (pp) chain}, the dominant fusion process in the Sun's core, where hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse into helium, releasing energy. Here's the breakdown of the stages shown: \par
  \textbf{Stage 1: Proton-Proton Fusion} — Two \emph{protons (red)} fuse to form: a \emph{deuteron} (one proton + one neutron — shown here as red + blue), a \emph{positron} (green), and a \emph{neutrino} ({\greekfont ν}). This happens twice independently. \textbf{Reaction:} $p + p \rightarrow \text{D} + e^+ + \nu_e$ \par
  \textbf{Stage 2: Deuteron-Proton Fusion} — The deuteron (p+n) fuses with another \emph{proton (red)} to form: \emph{Helium-3 (two protons, one neutron — 2 red + 1 blue)} a \emph{gamma ray} ({\greekfont γ}), indicating energy release. This also occurs in parallel twice. \textbf{Reaction:} $\text{D} + p \rightarrow \text{He-3} + \gamma$ \par
  \textbf{Stage 3: Helium-3 Fusion} — Two \emph{helium-3 nuclei} collide, forming: one \emph{helium-4 nucleus} (2 protons + 2 neutrons — 2 red + 2 blue), two free \emph{protons} (red), released back to the plasma. \textbf{Reaction:} $\text{He-3} + \text{He-3} \rightarrow \text{He-4} + 2p$ \par
  \textbf{Net Result} — The chain converts \emph{4 protons into 1 helium-4 nucleus}, with: energy carried by \emph{gamma rays}, \emph{neutrinos}, and \emph{kinetic energy} of the particles, two protons recycled. This chain is responsible for the Sun's energy production, light, and the solar neutrinos we detect on Earth. \par
  \textbf{Bottom (Quantum Tunneling):} Enables this entire process by allowing particles to skip energy barriers. The barrier dampens the probability wave without zeroing it. This quantum mechanical effect permits fusion to occur at the Sun's core temperature (15 million K), where classical physics predicts negligible fusion rates due to insufficient thermal energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier between protons.
