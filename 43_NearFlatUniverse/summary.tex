The universe appears flat to within 0.4\% precision according to cosmic microwave background measurements. This flatness, described by the Lambda-CDM model, indicates that space follows Euclidean geometry even across vast cosmological distances. The universe may be spatially infinite while having a finite age of 13.8 billion years. This implication comes from the Big Bang model: an expansion of intergalactic space rather than an explosion within pre-existing space. If space was already infinite at the beginning, it expanded uniformly from every point. No center to the universe!
