Physics' two most successful theories cannot coexist. Quantum field theory treats forces as particle exchanges on a fixed stage, while general relativity says the stage warps. When combined, they produce catastrophic contradictions: QFT predicts vacuum energy $10^{120}$ times larger than observed, gravity refuses renormalization, and black holes seem to destroy quantum information. Each theory works perfectly in its domain, yet they give mutually exclusive descriptions of reality. This incompatibility of theories is the most glaring problem in modern physics.
