Observations of distant supernovae in the 1990s revealed that the universe's expansion is accelerating, contradicting earlier models that predicted gravity would slow cosmic expansion. This acceleration requires dark energy, an unknown component comprising about 70\% of the universe's energy density. Dark energy counteracts gravity at cosmological scales, manifesting as either a cosmological constant in Einstein's equations or a dynamical field.
