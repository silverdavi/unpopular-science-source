Black holes create an observational paradox: external observers see infalling objects freeze at the event horizon with infinite redshift, while the falling objects cross in finite proper time experiencing nothing unusual. This contradiction arises from extreme spacetime curvature near the horizon ($r = 2GM/c^2$), where gravitational time dilation becomes unbounded. Inside the horizon, causality inverts â€” the radial coordinate becomes timelike, making the singularity not a place but a future moment that all trajectories must reach.
