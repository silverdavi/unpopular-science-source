Empty space isn't empty — and even that depends on who's looking. The quantum vacuum teems with field fluctuations, but more disturbing: two observers can fundamentally disagree about whether particles exist at all. An astronaut floating peacefully sees perfect vacuum around her. Her twin, firing rockets to accelerate through the same region, is bombarded by thermal radiation at temperature $T = ħa/2πck_B$ — the Unruh effect. The accelerating observer's particle detectors click frantically while the inertial observer's remain silent. Particle content becomes relative, like simultaneity in Einstein's relativity.
