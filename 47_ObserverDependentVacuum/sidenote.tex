  \textbf{Top (Unruh effect):}  
   Even in vacuum, observers may disagree on particle content. An accelerating observer detects a warm bath of particles where an inertial observer sees none.\par

  \textbf{Middle (The Andromeda Paradox and Relativity of Simultaneity):}  
  Two observers at the same point on Earth — one stationary, one walking — will disagree on what is happening right now (as seen from right here) in distant galaxies. A moon event (like an egg breaking) can be “now” for the stationary, and “not yet” for the runner.\par

  \textbf{Bottom (Quantum Fields and Observer-Dependent Particles):}  
  What counts as a particle depends on the observer. Each pink sphere represents a local quantum field mode, vibrating against the vacuum. But acceleration or curvature shifts the vacuum state, so an observer may see particles where another sees none — like Unruh radiation or Hawking emission. \par
