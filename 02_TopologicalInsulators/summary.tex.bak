Topological insulators exhibit an unusual combination of properties: insulating in their bulk yet conducting electricity perfectly along surfaces or edges. This behavior originates from the topology of the material's electronic energy structure in momentum space, which guarantees protected conductive states resistant to scattering and imperfections. The mathematical concept of topology, concerning properties preserved under continuous deformation, manifests physically through the way electron wave functions 'twist' as their momentum changes, leading to robust edge states and quantized conductance.
