  \textbf{Top (Einstein Monotile – The Hat Tile):}  
  Discovered by David Smith in 2022 and formalized in 2023 with Kaplan, Myers, and Goodman-Strauss, this 13-sided polygon — nicknamed the "hat" — was the first proven \textbf{aperiodic monotile}, or \textbf{einstein} (German for "one stone"). It tiles the plane completely without repeating periodically. Smith’s discovery also led to related tiles such as the "spectre," with matching-rule colorings, and to an infinite family of aperiodic monotiles. \par

  \textbf{Bottom (Imura Spiral Monotile):}  
  A symmetric monotile family discovered by Miki Imura in 2023. These tiles expand in four interlaced spiral arms and admit elegant 3-colorings. Although they can form periodic strip tilings, the illustrated spiral configuration highlights their mathematical and aesthetic appeal. The tile corners have angles of $3\pi/7$ and $4\pi/7$, permitting intricate lawful assemblies. \par
