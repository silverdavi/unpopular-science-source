\emph{"The geometry of space translates to a reoccurring theme in my creations: the tessellation. A tessellation is an arrangement of closed shapes that completely covers the plane without overlapping and without leaving gaps. The regular division of the plane had been considered solely in theory prior to me, some say. I diverged from traditional approaches, and chose instead to find solutions visually. Where other mathematicians used notebooks, I preferred to use a canvas."}\\
