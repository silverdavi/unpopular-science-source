The "Einstein problem", named from German "ein Stein" (one stone), asks whether a monotile could tile the plane only aperiodically. In 2023, David Smith, a retired printer experimenting with shapes, discovered the 13-sided "hat" that solved this 60-year puzzle. The hat tiles infinitely without ever repeating its pattern. The study of tilings previously revealed a connection between mathematics and physical quasicrystals, a discovery that won a Nobel Prize in 2011.
