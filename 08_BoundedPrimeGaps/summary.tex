In 2013, an unaffiliated Yitang Zhang proved there exists a finite bound B (initially 70,000,000) such that infinitely many prime pairs differ by at most B. While prime gaps can grow arbitrarily large, this breakthrough showed they cannot drift apart arbitrarily far. The Polymath8 collaboration subsequently reduced this bound to a few hundred. Zhang's approach combined distribution properties of primes in arithmetic progressions with an advanced sieving technique, resolving a fundamental question about number patterns while falling short of proving the Twin Prime Conjecture that infinitely many primes differ by exactly 2.
