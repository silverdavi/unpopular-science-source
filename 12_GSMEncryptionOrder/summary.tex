GSM mobile communications used stream ciphers to protect call privacy, but protocol design left them vulnerable. Encryption was applied only after error correction and formatting, so fixed training sequences and redundant coding produced predictable ciphertext patterns. These leaks allowed attackers to recover session keys with modest effort, demonstrating that security depended less on theoretical cipher strength than on overall system design.
