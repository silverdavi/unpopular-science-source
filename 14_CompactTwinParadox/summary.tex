In a cylindrical universe with compact spatial dimensions, twins can separate and reunite without acceleration, with one traveling around the circumference while the other remains stationary. Despite neither experiencing acceleration, they age differently upon reunion, creating a variant of the famous special relativistic paradox. In non-orientable topologies like Klein bottle universes, travelers can additionally experience reversal of chirality. Even a thoroughly non-dextrocardic explorer might come back from a cosmic stroll with his heart on the right side, no trauma needed.
