  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] Aaron ben Meir, claiming authority as a Tiberian scholar in the Holy Land, challenged this Babylonian dominance through calendar calculation.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] For the year 922, this meant Passover would fall two days earlier than the Babylonian calculation.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] His calculation might have reflected Jerusalem time versus Babylonian time — the 642 parts (an hour is 1080 parts) corresponding to the longitude difference between the two centers, or about questions of exact date of the Creation.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] But it was in fact less about the calendar and more about authority, challenging the Babylonian academy's authority to determine Jewish law in opposition to the Holy Land's leadership.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] The exilarch (leader of the Jewish diaspora, Reish Galuta) David ben Zakkai and the Babylonian academies excommunicated Ben Meir.

  - [05_CircleWheel/main.tex] The diagram illustrates systematic phonological transformations: de-labialization in Latin (colere) versus preservation as qu (e.g., equus, quattuor), palatalization in Sanskrit (chakra), contextual neutralization in Greek (kyklos), and fricativization through Grimm's Law in Germanic (wheel).
  - [05_CircleWheel/sidenote.tex] The PIE root *kʷékʷlos ("wheel, circle") appears across multiple branches with predictable phonological transformations: Greek κύκλος (kyklos) via labiovelar to velar shift, Sanskrit चक्र (chakra) through labiovelar palatalization, and English "wheel" via Grimm's Law (*kʷ > hw).
  - [05_CircleWheel/technical.tex] Summary: Greek neutralized labiovelars context-dependently (*kʷ > t/p/k), Sanskrit palatalized (*kʷ > c → चक्र), Latin generally preserved qu but de-labialized in certain roots like colere, and Germanic fricativized via Grimm's Law (*kʷ > hw → wheel).

  - [05_CircleWheel/main.tex] In Sanskrit, the form is दुहितृ (duhitṛ), preserving both the root and the feminine suffix.
  - [05_CircleWheel/main.tex] In Greek, κύκλος (kyklos) retained the meanings of "circle" and "wheel," later influencing Latin cyclus and English "cycle." Sanskrit preserved the root as चक्र (chakra), initially referring to a physical wheel, and later extended to cycles in philosophical and spiritual contexts.

Name: Saturday
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] This placed Japan on Sunday when locals observed Saturday.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] Most communities rejected this calculation, maintaining local Saturday as Shabbat.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] In Kobe — east of the Chazon Ish's calculated line — his view implied Shabbat would fall on Sunday while the local community observed Saturday.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] The Chazon Ish telegrammed back: "Eat Wednesday, fast Thursday, fear nothing." In Shanghai — west of his line — Shabbat was kept on Saturday with the established community.
  - [26_JewishCalendar/old_main.tex] But the responsum identifies an even more complex challenge involving geographical separation: "It is known that Europe and America are on opposite sides of the globe—so when Shabbat is sanctified in Europe, it is still Friday in America, and when havdalah is made in Europe on Saturday night, it...

  - [34_BoltzmannBrain/historical.tex] The 1998 discovery of cosmic acceleration implied a positive cosmological constant, suggesting our universe would expand forever into a de Sitter state.
  - [34_BoltzmannBrain/historical.tex] Lisa Dyson, Matthew Kleban, and Leonard Susskind (2002) showed that such universes face Boltzmann's original problem in its extreme form: eternal de Sitter space acts as a thermal bath that will fluctuate into any possible configuration, with smaller fluctuations exponentially dominating larger o...
  - [34_BoltzmannBrain/historical.tex] Don Page argued that in de Sitter space, the expected waiting time for a Boltzmann Brain in a horizon volume is roughly years — vastly shorter than the Poincaré recurrence time .
  - [34_BoltzmannBrain/main.tex] This leads to a de Sitter future: the universe will expand forever, approaching a maximum entropy state often called the "heat death." In this eternal vacuum, space maintains a tiny but non-zero temperature due to quantum fluctuations and the cosmological horizon.
  - [34_BoltzmannBrain/main.tex] Our universe's accelerating expansion — supported by supernovae data, cosmic microwave background measurements, and large-scale structure — appears to doom it to an eternal de Sitter phase where fluctuation-born observers dominate.

Name: Spanish
  - [05_CircleWheel/main.tex] Instead, we find that other Germanic languages show the *dʰegʷʰ- root (German Tag, Dutch dag), while Romance languages consistently reflect *dyéws (French jour from Latin diurnus, Spanish día).
  - [05_CircleWheel/main.tex] Another case involves English "much" and Spanish "mucho" — words that are nearly identical in sound and meaning yet stem from unrelated PIE roots.
  - [05_CircleWheel/main.tex] Spanish "mucho," however, comes from Latin multus ("many"), which traces to PIE *mel- ("strong").

  - [08_BoundedPrimeGaps/main.tex] Zhang's result drew attention for its mathematical content and the circumstances of its discovery — after completing his doctorate, he spent years outside academic mathematics, with no permanent university position and limited research output.
  - [08_BoundedPrimeGaps/main.tex] While Zhang's work addressed bounded gaps, the opposite question — how large prime gaps can become — has also attracted intense study.
  - [08_BoundedPrimeGaps/main.tex] Zhang's proof is concise and intricate.

Name: Zorn
  - [07_BilliardsConicsPorism/main.tex] Which reminds me of the joke by mathematician Jerry Bona, in which he described the equivalence of the Axiom of Choice, Zorn's Lemma, and the Well-Ordering Theorem as follows: "The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the Well-Ordering Theorem is obviously false, and Zorn's Lemma — who can tell?" T...

Name: Zugot
  - [26_JewishCalendar/historical.tex] The chain continued through specific named authorities: Shimon the Righteous (one of the last of the Great Assembly), Antigonus of Socho, then paired leaders through the generations — the Zugot (pairs), where one served as Nasi (president) and one as Av Beit Din (head of the court).
  - [26_JewishCalendar/main.tex] The chain of authority from Moses through the prophets, the Great Assembly, the Zugot, and the Nesi'im had preserved and developed this knowledge through centuries of astronomical observation and rabbinical refinement.

Name: Ångström
  - [25_FireflyBioluminescence/sidenote.tex] Top (Molecular Reaction): At the Ångström scale, the luminescent reaction begins: luciferin is enzymatically converted into luciferyl-adenylate, then oxidized into oxyluciferin.

Name: Élie Cartan
  - [21_ExponentialMapsLieTheory/historical.tex] In the early 20th century, Élie Cartan further extended these ideas into geometry and topology, embedding exponential maps into the study of curvature, connections, and geodesics.

Name: Ørsted Ampère Faraday
  - [04_EMFieldsEnergyFlow/historical.tex] Today, the principles laid down by Ørsted, Ampère, Faraday, Maxwell, Poynting, and Heaviside form the foundation of modern electromagnetism, from power grids to fiber-optic communication.
