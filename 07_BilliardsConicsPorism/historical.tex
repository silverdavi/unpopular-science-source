\begin{historical}
In the early 19th century, Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788–1867) pioneered projective geometry by examining how shapes transform under projection. Around 1822, he introduced the concept now known as Poncelet’s Porism, demonstrating that a closed polygon can be inscribed in one conic and circumscribed about another conic, provided it exists once for a given number of sides. This insight spurred an intense study of conic sections, with mathematicians such as Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi and Arthur Cayley extending Poncelet’s results to explore more algebraic properties of these curves.

Over the mid to late 19th century, researchers recognized a link between geometric theorems like Poncelet’s Porism and physical billiard trajectories. Elliptical billiards, in particular, drew interest when it was observed that the classical reflection law led to periodic paths that echoed Poncelet’s closure conditions. By the turn of the 20th century, these geometric investigations began intertwining with the nascent field of algebraic geometry, revealing that repeated reflections could be described by equations resembling elliptic or hyperelliptic curves.

%In the ensuing decades, mathematicians bridged classical geometry with modern integrable systems, building on foundational work by Poncelet, Jacobi, and Cayley to study billiards in higher dimensions and on more general algebraic varieties. Today, these studies continue to uncover new relationships between conic-based billiards, porisms, and the rich structure of elliptic curves, underscoring the enduring impact of 19th-century discoveries on contemporary mathematics.
