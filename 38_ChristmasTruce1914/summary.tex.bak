On Christmas 1914, enemy soldiers climbed out of their trenches and shook hands. Along sectors of the Western Front, British and German troops spontaneously ceased fire, met in No Man's Land to exchange tobacco and souvenirs, sang carols together, and buried their dead side by side. Some kicked footballs around shell craters. This unofficial truce lasted hours to days depending on location. By Christmas 1915, high command used coordinated artillery barrages to prevent any recurrence.
