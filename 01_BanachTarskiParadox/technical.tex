{\Large\textbf{Mathematical Foundations of the Banachâ€”Tarski Paradox}}

\textbf{Overview.}  
The Banach-Tarski paradox states that a solid ball in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) can be partitioned into finitely many disjoint subsets and using only rigid motions, reassembled into two identical copies of the original. The result depends on the Axiom of Choice, the existence of a free subgroup of \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\), and the absence of a finitely additive rotation-invariant measure on all subsets of the sphere.

\textbf{Construction Outline.}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Group-Theoretic Basis.}  
    The free group \(F_2 = \langle a, b \rangle\) is equidecomposable with two disjoint copies of itself under left multiplication. This violates the property of amenability, which forbids such duplications.

    \item \textbf{Geometric Embedding.}  
    Rotations \(S\) and \(T\) in \(\mathrm{SO}(3)\), each by angle \(\theta = \arccos(1/3)\) around orthogonal axes, generate a subgroup isomorphic to \(F_2\). No nontrivial reduced word in these rotations fixes any point off the axes.

    \item \textbf{Removing Fixed Points.}  
    The set \(D\) of all points fixed by nontrivial group elements is countable. One can remove \(D\) from the sphere by applying a suitable rotation to each of its images.

    \item \textbf{Orbit Decomposition.}  
    The action of \(F_2\) on \(S^2 \setminus D\) partitions it into orbits. The Axiom of Choice selects one representative per orbit to form a set \(M\). Then \(S^2 \setminus D = \bigsqcup_{g \in F_2} gM\).

    \item \textbf{Duplication via Equidecomposition.}  
    Since \(F_2 = A \sqcup B\) with \(A \cong F_2\) and \(B \cong F_2\), define bijections \(\phi_i : F_i \to F_2\), and extend them to \(S^2 \setminus D\) via \(x = gm \mapsto \phi_i(g)m\). This yields two disjoint subsets each equidecomposable with the whole.

    \item \textbf{Lifting to the Ball.}  
    The unit ball is viewed as concentric spherical shells. The paradoxical decomposition is applied to each shell simultaneously. The center is treated separately.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Amenability and Non-Amenability.}  
A group is amenable if there exists a finitely additive, invariant probability measure on all its subsets. Free groups on two or more generators are non-amenable: they admit no such measure. This failure is what allows equidecomposition of a set with two disjoint isometric copies of itself. The Banach-Tarski paradox is a geometric manifestation of non-amenability.

\textbf{Cayley Graph Interpretation.}  
The Cayley graph of \(F_2\) is a 4-regular tree. Each branch corresponds to a left coset, and the entire group acts by translation. It is somewhat easy to see that a careful merger of two opposite branches of the tree will result in a tree with the same structure as the original full tree, in a fractal way.

\textbf{Rotations Generating the Free Group.}  
Define $R = \frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2\sqrt{2} \\ 2\sqrt{2} & 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Then:
\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} R & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & R \end{bmatrix}
\]
Any reduced word \(W\) in \(S\), \(T\), and their inverses maps \((1,0,0)\) to a vector of the form \(\left( \frac{a}{3^n}, \frac{\sqrt{b}}{3^n}, \frac{c}{3^n} \right)\), with \(b > 0\), confirming that the group acts freely on the orbit of \((1,0,0)\).
