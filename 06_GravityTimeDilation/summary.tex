General relativity formulates gravity as spacetime curvature where time and space metrics are affected by mass and energy. Yet contrary to the depiction of gravity as bending space, like the rubber sheet visualizations, in cases in which masses are small (the Earth, for example) it is the gradient in time's rate that creates gravitational attraction, guiding objects toward regions of slower time. The reason an apple is falling is not because it is affected by force radiated by Earth, and neither due to the curvature of space but because it is following the shortest path through curved time.
