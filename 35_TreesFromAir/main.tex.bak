A tree's material body, the wood, leaves, and branches it accumulates year by year, is not extracted from the ground in the way stones or metals are quarried. Its dry mass arises from elements that were once distributed in dilute form throughout the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The key components of this mass, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, enter through invisible flows: air, water, and sunlight. A tree is built from what passes through it.

Although visually and mechanically tied to the soil, a tree records processes that unfold mostly above ground. The mass that persists after all water is removed, the dry matter, is composed primarily of carbon atoms originally fixed from atmospheric \(\mathrm{CO}_2\). The atoms were drawn down through the stomata of leaves, diffused through mesophyll tissue, and incorporated into sugar molecules via light-powered biochemical cycles. 

The notion that trees "grow out of the earth" conflates anchorage with origin. The soil does provide essential ions and mechanical stability, but its contribution to the actual mass is minor. Most of what endures in a dried trunk, cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, was once part of the air surrounding it. The verticality of a tree, its rise toward the sky, is materially made possible by the intake of that sky's gaseous contents.

The central process enabling this conversion is photosynthesis. It is a layered sequence of energy transduction and molecular reconfiguration. The first phase occurs in the chloroplasts of leaf cells, where chlorophyll pigments absorb incoming photons. The photons excite electrons to higher energy states, dislodging them from their atomic orbitals and initiating a cascade of electron transfers through the thylakoid membrane.

Oxygen-producing photosynthesis altered Earth's atmosphere and biosphere. When it first evolved in cyanobacteria around 2.5 billion years ago, it triggered the Great Oxygenation Event — a transformation that poisoned most existing anaerobic life but enabled the eventual emergence of complex organisms. The oxygen released by water-splitting is a byproduct that reshaped planetary chemistry. Every breath taken by an animal, every flame that burns, every rusting of iron depends on this ancient process continuing in plant chloroplasts. Trees are participants in a planetary-scale atmospheric engine that has operated continuously for billions of years.

The chain of transfers generates two critical energy carriers: ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The molecules store the electromagnetic energy harvested from light and shuttle it into the chemical domain. In the aqueous interior of the chloroplast, the stroma, the stored energy is used to convert inorganic carbon into organic intermediates.

Isotopes are versions of an element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. For example, oxygen has 8 protons and can have 8, 9, or 10 neutrons. This gives rise to the isotopes $^{16}\mathrm{O}$, $^{17}\mathrm{O}$, and $^{18}\mathrm{O}$. Carbon has 6 protons and can have 6, 7, or 8 neutrons. This gives rise to the isotopes $^{12}\mathrm{C}$, $^{13}\mathrm{C}$, and $^{14}\mathrm{C}$. Isotopes are a way to label atoms and track them in chemical reactions. This is how we know that the oxygen in wood comes from atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_2$, not from the soil.

When water molecules are split in photosystem II (oxygenic photosynthesis), their oxygen atoms are released directly to the atmosphere as \(\mathrm{O}_2\) gas. Isotope labeling experiments using $^{18}\mathrm{O}$-enriched water demonstrated that the heavy oxygen appeared in the released gas, not in the organic products. The oxygen atoms incorporated into cellulose and other biomolecules originate from \(\mathrm{CO}_2\). Every molecule of atmospheric oxygen released by plants represents a water molecule that was split to extract electrons, while the oxygen in wood records the atmospheric carbon that was fixed.

The fixation of carbon takes place in the Calvin–Benson cycle. Atmospheric \(\mathrm{CO}_2\) diffuses into leaf tissue and reacts with ribulose bisphosphate, a five-carbon sugar, under the catalytic action of the enzyme Rubisco. The resulting six-carbon intermediate is promptly split into three-carbon molecules, triose phosphates, that serve as building blocks for carbohydrates. The triose units are reassembled into glucose and other hexoses, which in turn feed biosynthetic pathways across the plant.

Sunlight delivers approximately 1,000 watts per square meter on a clear day — plants capture 1-3\% of this energy in chemical bonds. What is captured becomes concentrated: each kilogram of dry wood stores about 16-20 megajoules of energy, roughly equivalent to the combustion energy of natural gas. A single mature tree may contain 50-100 gigajoules of stored solar energy, accumulated over decades of photosynthetic capture. Millions of individual photons contribute quantum energy to the construction of molecular architecture that can persist for centuries.

Once synthesized, the sugars are exported from the site of fixation. Through the phloem, a network of conductive tissues, they are distributed to growing regions: root tips, shoot apices, developing leaves, and the vascular cambium. At the cambium, a cylindrical layer of dividing cells just beneath the bark, the imported carbohydrates are used to construct macromolecules.

Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin form the principal constituents of wood. Cellulose (C\(_6\)H\(_{10}\)O\(_5\))\(_n\) assembles into long, unbranched chains that crystallize into fibrils, giving tensile strength to cell walls. Hemicellulose (C\(_5\)H\(_{8}\)O\(_4\))\(_n\) binds the fibrils into a cohesive matrix, while lignin, a complex phenolic polymer, fills the spaces between them, adding compressive strength and water resistance. The polymers are laid down in geometric arrangements within the expanding walls of growing cells.

At the vascular cambium, cell division proceeds laterally, producing xylem cells toward the center and phloem cells outward. The radial expansion creates the familiar pattern of growth rings. Each ring corresponds to a cycle of photosynthetic capture and biosynthetic deposition.

Elongation occurs at the apical meristems, where undifferentiated cells divide and specialize into tissue types. The regions at the tips of roots and shoots coordinate patterning, orientation, and organogenesis. As cells expand and walls thicken, the imported sugars are converted into permanent form.

Hydrogen atoms in the biomass originate from water. Water is absorbed by roots and pulled upward through the xylem under tension. Though over 99\% of it eventually evaporates through stomatal pores, a small fraction is chemically incorporated into organic molecules. The hydrogen forms part of the fixed material, bound into carbohydrates and lipids.

Water's functional role extends beyond hydrogen donation. It serves as a solvent for ions, a medium for transport, and a buffer against temperature fluctuations. It enables the tree's biochemical metabolism and what remains after desiccation is not water but the elements it helped mobilize and bind.

Oxygen atoms in biomass come from \(\mathrm{CO}_2\). During photosynthesis, water molecules are split to provide electrons, but their oxygen atoms are released directly to the atmosphere as \(\mathrm{O}_2\) gas. The oxygen atoms incorporated into cellulose, forming hydroxyl, carboxyl, and ether linkages, originate from the atmospheric carbon dioxide that was fixed. The high oxygen content of wood, about 40 to 45 percent by weight, is a direct record of atmospheric \(\mathrm{CO}_2\) that was captured and converted into solid form.

Mineral ions absorbed from the soil are essential but contribute little to total mass. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrients serve catalytic and regulatory roles. They enable enzymatic function, membrane potential maintenance, and nucleic acid stability. Their aggregate proportion in dry matter is often less than 5 percent. They are mainly facilitators rather than substrates.

When all water is removed from a tree, what remains is a carbon-rich composite of organic polymers. Cellulose, lignin, and related molecules form a lattice of energy-stored mass, chemically stabilized and mechanically resilient. 

The transformation exhibits chemical symmetry. Photosynthesis builds sugar units from atmospheric inputs, 6\(\mathrm{CO}_2\) + 6\(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\) + \(\odot\) light → \(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_6\) + 6\(\mathrm{O}_2\), which are then polymerized into cellulose by removing water: n(\(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_6\)) → (\(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{10}\mathrm{O}_5\))\(_n\) + n\(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\). When wood burns, the process reverses exactly: (\(\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{10}\mathrm{O}_5\))\(_n\) + 6n\(\mathrm{O}_2\) → 6n\(\mathrm{CO}_2\) + 5n\(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\) + \Fire{} heat. The stored solar energy is released, and every atom returns to its original atmospheric or aqueous state. The carbon dioxide and water vapor that rise from the flame are identical to the molecules that entered the tree decades earlier. A tree is a temporary configuration of atmospheric components, held together by captured light. As Richard Feynman remarked, trees are "made of air". When a tree burns, the carbon returns to the atmosphere, and the stored sunlight is released as heat.
