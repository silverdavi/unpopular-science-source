Ask where a tree's mass comes from and intuition points downward: soil, water, nutrients drawn up through roots. This is almost entirely wrong. Trees are made of air — ~95\% of their dry mass comes from atmospheric CO₂. Through photosynthesis, plants build themselves from carbon dioxide, converting invisible gas into solid wood, cellulose, and lignin using sunlight. Van Helmont's 1640s willow experiment demonstrated this: a tree gained 164 pounds while the soil lost only 2 ounces. Isotope labeling confirms the molecular accounting — carbon in wood comes from air, not earth or water. When trees burn, they simply return their borrowed carbon and sunlight to the atmosphere,  completing a chemical cycle that temporarily crystallizes air into living architecture.
