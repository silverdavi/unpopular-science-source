\begin{historical}
The roots of thermodynamics trace back to early 19th-century efforts to understand the efficiency of heat engines. In the 1820s, Sadi Carnot introduced the idea of reversible cycles and the notion that heat could be partially transformed into work, bounded by what would later be called the second law of thermodynamics. His work, though framed in a caloric theory, anticipated a fundamental limitation: that no engine could be more efficient than a reversible one operating between two heat reservoirs.

Building on this foundation, Rudolf Clausius in 1865 formally introduced and named the concept of entropy, giving the second law a precise mathematical expression: in any real process, the total entropy of an isolated system tends to increase. Earlier, in 1851, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) offered an alternative formulation, asserting the impossibility of converting all heat from a single reservoir into work without other effects — essentially forbidding perpetual motion machines of the second kind.

While these formulations were macroscopic and phenomenological, physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann sought to derive them from microscopic principles, modeling gases as vast ensembles of molecules obeying Newtonian mechanics. This kinetic theory offered statistical interpretations of thermodynamic quantities, suggesting that entropy increase reflected the overwhelmingly probable behavior of particle ensembles rather than an inviolable mechanical law.

It was in this context — where thermodynamics was seen as emergent from statistical regularities, yet grounded in reversible microscopic dynamics — that James Clerk Maxwell introduced his thought experiment in 1867. He aimed to probe the assumptions underlying the second law by imagining an idealized being capable of intervening at the molecular level, potentially subverting the macroscopic flow of entropy without violating any mechanical law.
