Maxwell's Demon, proposed in 1867, describes a thought experiment where a tiny being controls a door between two gas chambers, selectively allowing fast molecules into one chamber and slow ones into another. This sorting creates a temperature gradient from uniformity, seemingly decreasing entropy and violating the second law of thermodynamics. The resolutions are through work costs of measurement and the information-theoretic cost of manipulating information.
