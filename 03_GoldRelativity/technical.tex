    \noindent\textbf{Quantum Mechanical Origin of High Electron Velocities}
    
    Electrons in atoms are described by wavefunctions obeying the Schrödinger equation:
    \[
    \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{r} \right] \psi = E \psi.
    \]
    The kinetic term penalizes localization, while the Coulomb term favors proximity to the nucleus. Their balance is constrained by the uncertainty principle: $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \gtrsim \hbar$.
    
    Strong nuclear attraction forces wavefunction localization near $r = 0$, requiring large momentum components and thus high typical velocities.
    
    In quantum mechanics, velocity is an operator:
    \[
    \hat{v} = \hat{p}/m, \quad \hat{p} = -i\hbar \nabla.
    \]

    For hydrogen-like atoms, the expectation value scales as $\langle v \rangle \sim Z\alpha c$. Where $ \alpha \approx 1/137 $. For gold (\(Z = 79\)), this yields \(\langle v \rangle \approx 0.58c\), indicating that inner electrons reach relativistic speeds.
    
    \noindent\textbf{Relativistic Orbital Contraction}

In Dirac hydrogenic theory, relativistic contraction is encoded in the Lorentz factor \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (Z\alpha)^2}}\). As \(Z\) increases, \(\gamma\) decreases from 1, leading to contraction of \(s\) orbitals relative to the non-relativistic case; \(p\) and \(d\) orbitals respond differently because of spin–orbit coupling and relativistic mass effects.

A compact heuristic sometimes used is \(v_{char} \sim Z\alpha c\) to illustrate that inner electron speeds can approach relativistic values as \(Z\) grows, though bound-state velocities do not have a single classical value.

This contraction has consequences for interband transitions and optical properties, as discussed in the following section.
    
    \noindent\textbf{Electronic Transitions and Optical Properties}
    
    Gold's configuration is [Xe]4f$^{14}$5d$^{10}$6s$^1$. Due to relativistic 6s contraction, the 5d–6sp gap narrows to:
    \[
    \Delta E \approx 2.4\,\text{eV} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda \approx 520\,\text{nm},
    \]
    in the blue region of the visible spectrum.
    
    In solids, these transitions span energy bands rather than discrete levels. Finite band widths and electron lifetimes broaden the absorption, leading to selective attenuation of blue light and reflection of red/green — the physical basis for gold’s color.
    
    \noindent\textbf{Other Relativistic Effects in Heavy Elements}
    
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Platinum (Grayish-white)}: Strong 6s contraction occurs with 5d$^9$6s$^1$ configuration. The partially filled d-band crosses the Fermi level, causing continuous interband transitions across the visible spectrum rather than discrete transitions, yielding a darker, grayish appearance.
    
    \item \textbf{Mercury (Liquid)}: Extreme 6s contraction creates a filled, contracted 6s$^2$ shell that cannot effectively overlap with neighboring atoms' orbitals, preventing metallic bonding. This results in weak van der Waals forces only, yielding a melting point of -38.8°C.
    \end{itemize}
