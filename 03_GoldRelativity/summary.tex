The yellow color of gold requires relativistic quantum mechanics to explain, unlike silver's silvery appearance. Electrons in gold atoms reach 58\% of light speed, causing changes in the 6s and 5d orbitals. This shifts absorption to blue wavelengths, resulting in the reflection of yellow-red light. Similar relativistic effects explain mercury's liquid state and platinum's white appearance. These everyday properties demonstrate how modern physics manifests in macroscopic observations.
